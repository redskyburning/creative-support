// Bulma/Buefy variables which need to be defaulted go here. These variables should not be reliant on values in Bulma/Buefy as they will be included before those values exist. New variables used in bulma-overrides should go in here as well, but variables that have nothing to do with Bulma/Buefy belong in variables.scss.
